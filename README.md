This is the project assignment for Week 3 of the "Coursera" course "Developing Data Products"(part of the Data Science Specialization). 

<b> Instructions </b>:
Create a web page presentation using R Markdown that features a plot created with Plotly. Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities. Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a plot created with Plotly. We would love to see you show off your creativity!
<b> Review criteria </b>:
The rubric contains the following two questions:
   1. Does the web page feature a date and is this date less than two months before the date that you're grading this assignment?
